# Bonus: Satin Cocoa Cookies Recipe (Baking English)

## Background Story

This activity started with a TikTok video in Arabic showing soft, shiny chocolate cookies. Olga translated the video using Google Translate, then tried baking the cookies – but they didn’t turn out as expected.

To improve the result, she asked an AI language model to:

1. Find a verified English version of the recipe.
2. Convert the ingredients from U.S. cups and ounces to a Polish-friendly system using grams and tablespoons.

This turned into a fun lesson in *baking English*, international measurements, procedural writing, and how to use AI for practical tasks.
