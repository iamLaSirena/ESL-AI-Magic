## 🧠 AI Assistants

These tools help me prototype, experiment and co-create magical ESL experiences:

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
  My go-to for roleplays, dialogues, concept drafting, and whispering soft language into lessons.

- **Claude (Anthropic)**  
  Ideal for emotionally nuanced prompts, philosophical dialogues and reflective storytelling.

- **Notion AI**  
  Perfect for lesson planning, journaling insights and creating asynchronous assignments.

- **Otter.ai**  
  For turning voice into text, capturing story-rich lessons, and building audio archives.

- **Tavily AI Search + Arc Browser**  
  For mindful, non-noisy research — perfect for when I need clarity instead of chaos.

## 📚 Prompting Inspiration

- **Learn Prompting** – https://learnprompting.org  
  Community-driven, constantly evolving — but filter it through your intuition.

- **Magai** – https://magai.co  
  Multimodal interface for AI conversations. I use it to test tone shifts.

- **Extrapolate.co**  
  Visual concept generator, great for metaphors and symbolic lesson starters.

## 🧰 Soft Tools

Not strictly “AI” — but sacred in my practice.

- **Papier (Chrome extension)** – gentle writing flow for journaling between tasks.  
- **Tana / Notion / Apple Notes** – for organizing my poetic chaos.  
- **Muse / Milanote** – mind-mapping visual lesson journeys.  
- **Miro** – if I want to think like a garden.
