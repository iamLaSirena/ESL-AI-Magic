# AI Language Design Framework  
**Author:** Józefina Bieżuńska (iamLaSirena)  
**Focus:** Designing emotionally intelligent, neurodivergent-friendly ESL experiences using AI.

## ✨ Overview:
This framework is a living structure for co-creating ESL learning experiences with AI.  
It honors intuition, reflection, and customization — while embracing the possibilities of Large Language Models as compassionate co-facilitators.

---

## 🌿 The Flow:

### 1. **Intention Setting**
> Ask yourself or the learner: *What do we want to feel and explore today?*

Examples:
- “I want to feel more confident at the pharmacy.”
- “I want to have fun talking about my favorite book.”
- “I want to practice asking questions without freezing.”

This step anchors the session in real emotional or situational context.

---

### 2. **Prompt Crafting**
Write or select a prompt that activates the chosen theme.  
Include tone, roleplay type, level of support needed, and specific constraints (e.g. “be warm but realistic”, “give feedback only at the end”).

Examples:
- “Act as a British receptionist who asks the student about their check-in.”
- “Simulate a job interview for a warehouse position. Give tips in between answers.”

---

### 3. **Dialogic Play**
Let the learner interact with the AI.  
Let it be imperfect, messy, real.  
Encourage pauses, retries, and natural emotions.

The teacher can observe silently or intervene gently if needed.  
Optional: Use emotion-tagging (e.g. [nervous], [excited]) to support emotional nuance.

---

### 4. **Reflection & Feedback**
After the conversation, invite a reflection:
- “What surprised you?”
- “Was anything easier than you expected?”
- “Would you like to try the same again but slower / funnier / more serious?”

AI can also offer feedback, but always in a soft, constructive tone:
> “You did really well explaining your situation! One little tip: try using ‘could’ instead of ‘can’ when asking politely.”

---

### 5. **Re-Prompting or Reinforcement**
You can now:
- replay the same situation with a twist (different tone, time pressure, surprise event)
- switch roles (student becomes the shop assistant!)
- ask the AI to summarize key phrases or generate a vocabulary map

---

### 🌸 Bonus: Emotional Anchoring
Invite the student to name the *feeling state* at the end:
> “I feel clearer.” / “I feel playful.” / “Still a bit nervous, but better.”

This helps track progress in **confidence**, not just correctness.

---

## 🌙 Closing Note:
This is not a rigid model.  
This is a ritual of responsiveness.  
Learning a language is learning a rhythm — and AI can help echo it, if prompted with care.
