# 🪄 ESL AI Magic

Welcome to **ESL AI Magic** – a curated space for prompt engineering workflows, automation systems, and content design for English language learning. This repo documents my work as a Prompt Engineer supporting dynamic ESL education through LLM-based tools.

## 🎯 What I do

As a **Prompt Engineer**, I specialize in designing, testing, and refining prompts that turn AI into a flexible and responsive teaching assistant. I build systems that support teachers, engage learners, and save countless hours of manual work.

## 🔧 My responsibilities

- Designing smart prompts for:
  - Lesson summaries (PDF/Word) with vocabulary, quizzes, and personalized feedback
  - Speaking activities and storytelling scripts (based on learner personas)
  - Grammar exercises with built-in level control (A2/B1 and B1+)
  - Functional dialogues for real-life scenarios (e.g., airport, shopping, expat life)
- Creating modular prompt templates for easy reuse
- Building long-term context systems using memory and instruction layers
- Iterating based on real student data and teacher feedback

## 💡 My approach

- Human-first, learner-centered design  
- Iteration, testing, and contextual grounding  
- Transparent logic and clean structure in every prompt  
- Multilingual sensitivity (Polish, Ukrainian, English)

## ✨ Key use cases

- **Sylwia & Sharks** – personalized, real-time ESL summaries with review tasks and quizzes  
- **Wojciech’s Adverb Adventures** – grammar and vocabulary tailored to a learner’s thought process  
- **Szybki Polski 1.0** – Polish for Slavic speakers, with spiral learning and storytelling magic  
- **Grammar Quiz Generator** – smart A/B versions with humor, logic, and level-aware traps  

## 🧠 Why it works

Thanks to this prompt system:
- Teachers can focus on real interaction, not paperwork  
- Learners get targeted, relevant feedback and practice  
- Content is always aligned with learner needs and learning styles  
- It scales: new students, new languages, new formats – no problem
